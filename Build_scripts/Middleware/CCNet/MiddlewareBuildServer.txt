Middleware build server notes

Build server: 
Virtual machine "build1" on Solserv1

Build Interval: 
1. Daily 3:30 AM build
2. Force build via cctray

Repository access:
Incremental update with clean build via msbuild.

CCNet layout
o Config files are in "C:\Program Files (x86)\CruiseControl.NET\server" folder.
o CCNet state, logs, and artifacts -> "c:\builds\CCNet"
o Repositories and build area is in "c:\builds\source"

TODO
o Build server needs it's own GIT user, not bhuzyk
o CCNet builds are accessible via web browser locally on build1 system, but not via the network.
o Software dependencies need to be documented (VS2010, VS2012 etc)
o Modify build to delete most repositories, so that we start clean.
o Support targeted build through cc.net. -> probably through a forced build, need to somehow get build version to scripts.
o Automatic GIT tagging <- Jury is out on this, will probably be implemented with a script that is manually run when we determine the build is the one that we want to release.
