Omni-ID Middleware version 1.03.1118.1
11/18/13

Current Limitations:
1. Install tested with installs to C: drive. Installs to other drives may work but 
   would require manual changes to the scripts in the OmniAppInsert.sql file 
   that have path names in them.
2. Installs to 32-bit operating systems would require manual changes to the 
   scripts in the OmniAppInsert.sql file that have path names in them.


Upgrade Instructions
For Middleware v1.01.1029.0 and earlier.
1. Remove previous "Omni-ID Middleware" version (Windows add/remove programs)
2. Delete "C:\ProgramData\Omni-id\Middleware\Config\QueueNames.txt"
3. Drop all of the OmniApplication_* tables in the following order (IMPORTANT: 
   you will loose any Omni Impinj reader app settings): 
	a. OmniApplication_Parameter
	b. OmniApplication_ParameterCategory
	c. OmniApplication_ParameterType
	d. OmniApplication_Application
	e. OmniApplication_ScheduledApps
	f. OmniApplication_ScheduleType
	g. OmniApplication_YesNo. 
4. Make sure that you run the "OmniAppCreate.sql" and "OmniAppInsert.sql" commands 
   in the steps below.

   
Prerequisites:
1. SQL Server 2008 R2 any edition (or newer) or SQL Server 2008 Express.
2. Microsoft .NET framework version 4.5 
   [ http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653 ]


Quick Start Instructions:
1. Uninstall existing Omni-Middleware installation through control panel 
   add/remove programs.

2. Delete "C:\ProgramData\Omni-id\Middleware\Config\QueueNames.txt" if it exists.

3. Turn Windows UAC (User Account Control) to off or its lowest level.

4. Firewall, open up port for CALCMan.

5. Optional. Install "Bonjour for Windows" if Multicast DNS support for the "Omni Impinj Reader app"
   is desired.

6. Install "Omni-IDMiddlewareSetup_xyz.exe", which installs the following components:
	+---Program Files (x86)
	    +---Omni-ID
	        +---CALC Manager
		+---ClientConfigurator
	        +---Middleware
	        |   +---bin			// Omni-Middle .NET assemblies
	        |   +---dbScripts		// Initial scripts for database setup
	        |   +---docs			// assorted Middleware documentation
	        |   \---sample_source
	        +---Omni Image Generator
	        +---Omni Import Connection String
	        +---OmniImpinjReader
	        +---OmniLogServer
	        \---OmniSysSchedConsole

7. For new installs, execute the following database scripts in this order: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Omni-ID\Middleware\dbScripts]
	a. CreateCALCManDB.sql
	b. CreateCALCManStoredProcedures.sql
	c. CreateCALCManTables.sql
	d. InsertCALCManDB.sql
	e. OmniAppCreate.sql
	f. OmniAppInsert.sql
   The scripts should completed successfully with no errors.

8. Modify the C:\Program Files (x86)\OMNI-ID\CALC Manager\CALCManService.exe.config file. 
   Set the correct database connection string in the "CALCManEntities" key.

9. From the start menu, run the "Omni Import Connection String" program. Type your 
   database connection string into the “New Connection string” text box”, 
   and press the Import button. The program should report a success status. 
   An example database connection string is (no quotes): 
   "Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=CALCMan;Integrated Security=True;"

10. From the start menu, run the "Middleware Client Configurator" program. 
    Use the "Add new client" button to configure Middleware clients. In most 
	cases the host name and client host names will be "localhost". The OmniMiddlewareClient
	constructor and app.config values will be generated for each Middleware client.	Changes 
	to the configuration will take effect when the associated service/app is restarted.
	
	Current restrictions:
	1. All instances of the Omni Impinj reader app must be run on the computer that the 
	   OmniSystemScheduler is running on.
	2. Host name fields should be set to localhost if the Middleware client is 
	   executing on the same machine. If not, it should be set to the machine name
	   the service or app is running on.
	3. Client host names should be set to localhost if the Middleware client is 
	   executing on the same machine. If not, it should be set to the machine name
	   the service or app is running on.
	4. It may not be possible to click on a control with a validation error to gain focus.
		Workaround: Tab to the control with the keyboard.
	   
	   Example 1: CALCMan is running on the same computer as the Middleware client.
	              CALCMan host name: "localhost"
				  CALCMan client host name: "localhost"
				  
	   Example 2: CALCMan is running a  computer named "MW_Server" and the the Middleware client
				  is running on a computer named "MW_Client"
	              CALCMan host name: "MW_Server"
				  CALCMan client host name: "MW_Client"   

11. Make sure that the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Omni-ID\Middleware\bin\log4net.config" is present in
    the directory that your applications assemblies are located.

12. Reboot computer, to start services and startup programs.

13. Special OmniImpinj app setup instructions:
    a. Click the "Configure Reader Host" button.
    b. Press OK on the "No Interface Settings Found" dialog.
    c. Press "Save Changes" on the "Configure / Create Reader Host Configurations"
    d. Setup a new reader configuration, press "Configure Readers", then Press 
	   "Add New Reader"
